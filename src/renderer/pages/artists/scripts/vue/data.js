        content: 'Godsmack is a hard rock/alternative metal band from Lawrence, Massachusetts, United States which formed in 1995. The band comprises founder, frontman and songwriter Sully Erna, guitarist Tony Rombola, bassist Robbie Merrill, and drummer Shannon Larkin. Since its formation, Godsmack has released five studio albums, one EP, four DVDs, and one greatest hits collection.\n\nThe band has had three consecutive #1 albums (Faceless,IV,The Oracle) on the Billboard 200. Godsmack\'s fifth studio album, titled The Oracle was released on May 3, 2010. The band has also parked a ratified 18 top ten rock radio hits, including 15 songs in the Top Five, more than bands such as Linkin Park and Metallica. Godsmack are one of the most popular metal acts of the last decade in the United States, selling over 19 million records worldwide.\n\nSince its inception, Godsmack has toured on Ozzfest on more than one occasion, and have toured with many other large tours and festivals, including supporting its albums with its own arena tours. In the summer of 2009, Godsmack toured as support to Mötley Crüe\'s Crüe Fest 2 tour.\n\nIn February 1995, Sully Erna decided to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for more than 23 years, including over two years in the now-defunct band Strip Mind.  His new band The Scam formed with Erna on vocals, Robbie Merrill on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and Tommy Stewart on drums. The Scam quickly changed its name to Godsmack, after recording one demo.  The newly formed band started playing small bars in their hometown of Boston, Mass.. Locally popular songs such as "Keep Away" and "Whatever" soon brought them to the top of the hit charts in the Boston/New England area.\n\nThe band\'s name, according to Merrill in the Smack This! DVD, was taken from the Alice in Chains\' song "God Smack". However, Erna stated in a 1999 interview that "I was making fun of somebody who had a cold sore on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, \'It\'s a godsmack.\' The name stuck. We were aware of the Alice in Chains song but didn\'t really think much about it. It\'s a cool song and the name had meaning for us".\n\nIn 1996, Tony Rombola and Joe D\'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left after finding out he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled "All Wound Up". The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.\n\nFor the next two years, the band played throughout the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack\'s CD landed in the hands of Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put "Keep Away" into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM).\n\nIn an interview Sully Erna stated, "we had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over records a week. It was insane. Even crazier, I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off."\n\nAlice in Chains is believed to be the primary influence to Godsmack. Many believe Godsmack obtained their name from the Alice in Chains song "God Smack" off the album Dirt. In an interview with MTV upon the death of Alice in Chains lead singer Layne Staley, Godsmack frontman Sully Erna stated that Staley "was single-handedly the guy that got me to start singing."  Erna went on to later confirm that indeed "God Smack" is the inspiration for the bands name and the reason their sound sounds similar to that of Alice in Chains Other bands cited by Godsmack members as their primary influences typically include Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Rush,  Black Sabbath, ² and White Zombie. More recently, Godsmack have attempted to distance themselves from the Alice in Chains comparison with Erna stating in an interview with Matt Ashare, "I\'ve just never really heard that in our music." In that same interview, Erna offers an alternative explanation to the origin of their band name by stating, "It happened at rehearsal when our drummer came in with a big cold sore on his lip. I was making fun of him all day because we had a photo shoot coming up. And then the next day when I came in, I had a big cold sore on my lip. So my guitar player said, See, God just smacked you for making fun of him." Nevertheless, the comparison to Alice in Chains is well documented. Sully Erna\'s style of singing mirrors that of Layne Staley\'s while the overall sound of the band\'s first two albums sound incredibly similar to the sound of Dirt. The logo of Godsmack is similar to the sun logo of Alice in Chains. Godsmack also released an album titled "Faceless" which is similar in name to Alice in Chain\'s first album Facelift. The band even transcended from their heavy sound to a more mellow acoustic sound on their album "The Other Side" in the same manner Alice in Chains did in "Jar of Flies".\n\nIn 2002, Godsmack received a Grammy nomination in "Best Rock Instrumental Performance" for the song "Vampires" from the album Awake. In 2004, they opened for Metallica, while headlining with Dropbox in the summer. They did acoustic shows for their newly released album The Other Side in the fall of 2004, while still opening for Metallica. In September 2004, Godsmack issued a live DVD titled "Changes" which the band recorded earlier that year. That same month, the group also released "Batalla de los Tambores", a live cut available only via online services such as Apple\'s iTunes Music Store, Real and Napster. They released their latest album \'The Oracle\' on May 3rd, 2010.\nSome songs from the album "Faceless" are also in the video game soundtrack for "Prince of Persia: Warrior Within".\n\nCurrent members\n\n* Sully Erna - Vocals, Lyrics, Guitar and Percussion.\n* Robbie Merrill - Bass and Backing Vocals\n* Tony Rombola - Guitars and Backing Vocals\n* Shannon Larkin - Drums/Percussion <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Godsmack">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        content: 'Dope is a industrial metal/nu-metal band that was founded in 1997 and immediately exploded onto the New York City club scene. After only a handful of shows, Dope secured a major label deal with Epic / Flip Records in 1998. The band\'s self-produced debut, \'Felons and Revolutionaries\', was released in 1999, and nonstop touring fueled the band\'s success. Dope did several national tours with acts like Slipknot, Sevendust, Mudvayne, Fear Factory, Staind, Static-X, and Kid Rock earning Dope a reputation for being one of the most exciting live bands of the new millennium. Dope’s non-stop touring and impressive live performances helped their debut release to SoundScan more than 250,000 units, creating the foundation that they would continue to build on in the years to come.\n\nThe track "Debonaire" is notable for being used in the 2001 film The Fast & The Furious.\n\nSuccessful headlining tours and Dope’s second album “Life” followed in 2001. The band’s sound matured and the record was received with excellent reviews by both the media and fans alike. Unfortunately, the band’s two labels were not functioning well together anymore. The label support and focus was non-existent for Dope at this very crucial time and there was very little awareness surrounding the album’s release.\n\nInstead of becoming bitter and fading into oblivion, Dope decided to take matters into their own hands. After confirming the band’s release from both of their original record deals, Dope quickly returned to the studio and created its third album “Group Therapy”; a collection of 13 new songs which included a full-length music video for every song on the album. With the major label jitters still fresh in their heads, Dope chose not to shop this new record to the record labels. Instead, Dope independently released “Group Therapy” in October of 2003 and set out on tour to promote the album themselves. The band did several successful headlining runs and supported acts like Mushroomhead, Slayer, Static-X and Saliva. Independently, “Group Therapy” has scanned nearly 50,000 units in less than a year. In total, Dope has scanned close to 400,000 combined units in its career.\n\nNow that they have proven to themselves and to the industry that there is still a strong demand for Dope, the band has completed its fourth album “American Apathy” and has inked a new deal with Artemis Records (home of Zakk Wylde’s Black Label Society, Kittie, and Sugarcult). The new album is a return to the band’s roots with a heavy guitar driven roar and political overtones in the lyrical content. This may very well be the strongest, most exciting Dope album to date.\n\nDope has just finished up headlining the Jagermeister sponsored “American Apathy Tour 2004” featuring Dope and former Ozzfest acts Motograter and Twisted Method. The tour hit over 70 cities in 11 weeks. Dope utilized this tour to showcase songs from the new album and as the first step to begin creating awareness around the new Dope album “American Apathy” to be released this spring.\n\nDope has survived the politics of the business and the ever-changing flavor of the month trends. They are proving that they are not part of any one genre, instead, they have created their own. Ask anyone wearing a black t-shirt at a hard rock or heavy metal concert what they think of the band Dope, and they are sure to respond with devil horns and a smile. The conclusion is that people like Dope. Reconnecting Dope with the people is their goal in 2005.\n\nNow preparing to release their 5th studio album, Dope has recruited a new drummer, Angel, formerly of the Genitorturers, to kick off their promotional tour.\n\nDope has recently released their highly anticipated new album "No Regrets". The album was launched March 10th 2009, on Koch Records. Tracks included on the album include "6-6-Sick", "Addiction" Ft. Zakk Wylde, "Nothing For Me Here" (was featured on Guitar Hero 3), and Billy Idol Cover Song "Rebel Yell".\n\nTo Date (6/13/09) The album is rated 4 1/2 out of 5 stars based on 21 reviews on cdnow.com.\n\nAfter releasing album No Regrets along with lots of touring after and before, they decided to take a little easier and stopped touring regularly for a while. Dope started working their new album "Blood Money, Part 1" and they dropped a few teasers from the album in 2012 and in 2013 which also said that the album would be released in 2014.\n\nIn 2015 Dope played a few gigs in Russia for the first time with their original "Die MotherFucker Die" line-up and they also recorded their very first live album in Moscow. Live album, titled "Live In Moscow", was released in 2016 summer with crowdfunding process via their website where all the people who pre-ordered the live album could f.ex. have their name on its live albums liner notes and also could make the thermometer grow with their shopping at their band website. Thermometer had different types of goals like releasing live dvd and going to U.K. and Europe for a tour.\n\nAfter releasing Dope\'s first live album, band announced that they will be releasing their long awaited album "Blood Money, Part 1" in the autumn of 2016 also stating that the second part of "Blood Money" wouldn\'t take so long time to release as "Part 1" did.\n\nDope released their first tour dates in USA for a long time after releasing their live album in summer. The tour was called "Die Mother Fucker Die Reunion" it including the original line-up from the "Life" album. "Blood Money, Part 1" was released in October 28th in 2016. After releasing the record, band went to Russia and United Kingdom as a headline tour along with the "Die Mother Fucker Die Reunion" tour.\n\nIn the beginning of 2017 Dope released some more tour dates for spring 2017 with co-headliner Combichrist and support acts September Mourning and Davey Suicide. \n\nIt\'s been rumored that Dope will come to Europe to play some festival gigs in the summer of 2017 but nothing official yet hasn\'t been released. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Dope">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They have collaborated with musicians such as Chino Moreno from Deftones, Fred Durst from nu metal band Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, Tre Hardson from The Pharcyde, Skrillex and Nas.\n\nThe band released their first demo album, Neidermeyer\'s Mind, in 1993. Their debut album, Korn was released in 1994, where they featured the same musicians that had performed on Neidermeyer\'s Mind. The band began recording Life Is Peachy in April 1996, and released it on October 15, 1996. Follow the Leader is recognized as Korn\'s mainstream breakthrough, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1998, along with the following album, Issues in 1999. The band released Untouchables on June 11, 2002, and later released Take a Look in the Mirror on November 21, 2003, both peaking in the top ten of the Billboard 200. Their first compilation album, Greatest Hits Vol 1, peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. See You on the Other Side was released on December 6, 2005, and Korn\'s untitled album was released nearly two years later on July 31, 2007. Korn III: Remember Who You Are, the band\'s ninth studio album, was released July 13, 2010 via Roadrunner Records. In 2011, they released an album called The Path of Totality and with the album, they added sounds and instruments of dubstep with their nu metal sound.\n\nThe Get Up! Songfacts reports that Korn\'s 10th studio album, The Path Of Totality was produced by various dubstep, drum and bass, and electro house artists due to the band\'s desire to fuse their traditional sound with electronic elements. released on December 2, 2011 in Europe and December 6, 2011 in the US. Davis explained the album title: "The title The Path of Totality refers to the fact that in order to see the sun in a full solar eclipse, you must be in the exact right place in the exact right time. That\'s how this album came together. I think all the producers feel the same way. I\'m not sure it could ever happen again."\n\nKorn currently has over 36 singles, over 25 of which have charted. The band has over 5 video albums and over 34 music videos.\n\nKorn has sold over 19 million albums in the US, and over 40 million worldwide. Ten of the band\'s official releases have peaked in the top ten of the Billboard 200, eight of which have peaked in the top five. Eight of those releases are certified Platinum by the RIAA, and one is certified Gold. Korn have also earned seven Grammy nominations — two of which they have won (for "Freak on a Leash" and "Here to Stay").\n\nKorn say they will release a new album soon in 2013, saying it will be aggressive, heavy and having "in your face!" vocals and to sound like their roots. Brain Welch also says he will perform at some concerts with them in January 2013. He also says he will later on rejoin the band. But he left the band originally to rededicate his life back to Christianity. While David, left and opened a bar in Bakersfield, California.\n\nThey were the first band to be labeled as nu metal, people say they were starting the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Alongside this genre, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal, rap rock, alternative metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal with grunge and hip-hop. Their lyrics focus mostly on stuff like personal alienation, pain, social anger, issues, memories, personal views and thoughts and sometimes revenge. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world. The band, especially their frontman Jonathan have rejected the metal label. Although Munky said he never considered the band as nu metal. In their Issues album, they reduced slightly the rap sounds they had, but returned to it with Take a Look in the Mirror going back to their roots and being very aggressive, but with See You On the Other Side, they took influences from industrial metal but went back to the sound of Untouchables and Issues with their Untitled album. These are examples of their musical style and direction.\n\nFormer Members\n\nDavid Silveria – drums, percussion (1992–2006)\n\nhttp://www.korn.com\nGenre: Nu metal\nLabels: Immortal Records, Roadrunner Records <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Korn">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        content: 'Lamb of God is an American groove metal band, originally formed under the name Burn the Priest.\n\nThe roots of Lamb of God were planted in the year 1990, when Mark Morton, Chris Adler and John Campbell were friends at Virginia Commonwealth University. The trio began playing at Adler\'s house in Richmond weathering chilly conditions. "There was no heat in the house," recalls Campbell. "We would hang around the kerosene heaters, get really drunk and write metal songs. Fumes and Black Label beer were definitely what fueled our early days."\n\nAfter graduation, Morton moved to Chicago to pursue a master\'s degree, but the band continued. A new guitarist, Abe Spear, replaced Morton as the band retired its instrumental sound and added Randy Blythe on vocals.\n\nThe quartet, known then as Burn the Priest, became a fixture in the tightly-knit Richmond music scene. To compete with the high-level of musicianship displayed by their contemporaries, the band adopted a rigid practice schedule. "To this day, we practice five days a week out of necessity," says Campbell. "The bands in Richmond can flat outplay you and if you don\'t practice, they will blow you off the stage. Bands like Breadwinner and Sliang Laos - two local math-metal bands - could play insanely complicated music note perfect. They inspired us to raise the bar musically and taught us the work ethic we needed to be a success."\n\nThe band was playing around Virginia when Mark Morton moved back from Chicago and re-joined the group. Soon after, Burn the Priest released a self-titled full length album on Legion Records. Abe left soon after, which opened a spot for guitarist, and brother to Chris - Willie Adler.\n\nA year after the second Adler joined, in 2000, Burn the Priest changed its name to Lamb of God, and signed a record deal with Prosthetic Records. The band\'s independent-debut, New American Gospel, was released in the year 2000. "This album was all about creating a rhythmic and pummeling musical landscape with riff after riff," explains Morton. Drummer Adler notes: \'\'This is a classic record. We had all the elements come together to make one of the heaviest, yet contagious records of our career. It was difficult to contain us - we didn\'t even understand at the time what we had created."\n\nTwo years of extensive touring to support the album raised Lamb of God\'s profile before the band released the critically acclaimed, As The Palaces Burn (2003). ATPB won record of the year honors in such notable magazines as Revolver and Metal Hammer while garnering mainstream press in Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly.\n\nThe band hit the road again and began headlining tours across the globe. In the fall of 2003 Lamb of God was a co-headliner on the first ever MTV\'s Headbanger\'s Ball Tour which elevated Lamb of God beyond the underground. The band then released Terror and Hubris, a DVD, featuring early live performances, videos for "Ruin" and "Black Label" and behind-the-scenes footage highlighting the work ethic, humility and sense of humor of one of the most respected and influential bands around today. The DVD proved to be a commercial success as it entered the Billboard Music DVD Charts at #32.\n\nGradually, Lamb of God\'s persistence paid off. Their 2003 disc, As The Palaces Burn earned them a new level of respect and admiration, but it was 2004\'s virulent major label debut (Epic Records) Ashes of the Wake that turned the band into true contenders for the metal throne. By mid 2006, the record had sold over 275,000 copies. Revolver magazine voted it the album of the year, a Guitar World readers poll deemed it best metal album and awarded the band "most valuable players," "best shredders" and "best riffs." The video for "Now You\'ve Got Something to Die For" earned "best video" from both Headbanger\'s Ball and Revolver. And a DVD chronicling the tour and life on the road with the band, Killadelphia, has gone gold. Lamb of God supported Ashes with more relentless touring, now playing mostly arenas and festivals, starting with a headlining run on Second Stage at Ozzfest 2004, and ending by headlining the North American Sounds of The Underground Festival in 2005.\n\nThe political angst that fueled the lyrics on As The Palaces Burn continues unabated on Ashes of the Wake. However, Blythe admits that his plans to write songs about personal responsibility quickly changed. "Mark and I write most of the lyrics together, and at the start of this album we agreed that we wanted to concentrate on internal instead of external politics," he explains. "But as we got into it, considering the condition of the world today, we felt obligated as responsible artists to give accurate social commentary, and that meant writing a few indictments against the powers that be."\n\nMixing a call to arms with a sneering disdain balances Ashes of the Wake. "In the end, I think the album is stronger because we show the relation between internal and external politics instead of just focusing on one or the other," Blythe says. "These songs are a reality check for everyone because they rail against a wrong-headed government and against the apathetic people that ignore the government and allow it to exist."\n\nAfter Ashes of the Wake, they had been praised as one of the leaders of the new American metal movement, and while they were flattered to be considered part of something so influential, this time they wanted to stand alone. "I believe it\'s important for us to create a legacy for this band, and I don\'t want that legacy to be in association with anyone else," Adler says. "In our minds, we\'re a cut above and we feel like we put out a whole lot more."\n\nTowards the end of 2005, the band stopped all touring and came home to Richmond, VA, to begin writing the next chapter. An intense 8 month writing process followed. "We pretty much killed ourselves working on it five to six days a week for six to eight hours a day," says drummer Chris Adler. "It was important to push ourselves into uncomfortable territory as players. A lot of times one of us would say, \'I\'m not sure if I can play that.\' The typical response was, \'Well, you\'ve got a year to figure it out.\' We pushed ourselves to step it up and threw out a lot of decent material because we were insisting on only the best." One reason Lamb of God pushed so hard is because they wanted to create something that couldn\'t be classified, categorized or marginalized.\n\nAugust 22, 2006 brought Sacrament, a stunning example of how diverse, articulate and pummeling metal can be. It\'s a record that emphasizes just how far the band members have come as players, writers and people and stands as a true testament of triumph over adversity. With Sacrament, Lamb of God has stoked the flames by stripping the flesh to the bone and examining the carnage. The songs are bleak and dark, yet key ingredients of a ride that\'s as breathless, exhilarating and terrifying as an overdose.\n\nGuitarist and co-lyricist Mark Morton notes the band chose the name Sacrament based on a specific lyrical reference as well as a more general symbolic perspective. "We like it because it employs the idea of the traditional religious Sacrament, which is something you do as ritual to get to a different level of your faith," he says. "Also, I thought it was symbolic in terms of us putting out another record and getting to the next stage of our musical development." "This is definitely a personal record and it\'s the darkest thing we\'ve ever done," adds Blythe. "It stems from a lot of depression and a fucked up worldview. In the last couple years I\'ve been going through a lot of weird, bad shit."\n\nThe biggest difference between Sacrament and Ashes of the Wake is the lyrical content. In the past, Lamb of God has lyrically been motivated by the hypocrisy, greed and turmoil of politics and politicians. This time the band turned within to reveal an even greater source of despair and frustration.\n\nSongs like \'Pathetic\' and \'Descending\' for instance are about the whirlpool of addiction and alcoholism, \'Walk With Me In Hell\' addresses the destruction of codependency and \'Blacken the Cursed Sun\' confronts suicidal depression.\n\n"The lyrics were so intense for me, when I was recording, it was like breathing pain instead of breathing air," Blythe says. "So, when it was done, I couldn\'t listen to the record for another two months. It just took so much out of me to get all this stuff out, I didn\'t want to touch it right away."\n\nIn addition to being relatively heavy, Sacrament is a sincere expression of the turmoil that has tumbled through the last few years of the band\'s existence. In an era of stagnant, contrived metal, Lamb of God is a harrowing rush of honesty, a declaration that no matter what anyone else is playing, Lamb of God will always follow their own hearts.\n\n"This band was started because no one out there was making the music that we wanted to hear," singer Randy Blythe says. "So, we decided to make that music, and from that point it has just been a continuation of that philosophy. We had never changed anything we do to appeal to anyone, appease anyone or seek any sort of approval from anyone other than ourselves."\n\nIn 2009, Lamb of God released their sixth studio album \'Wrath\' which debuted at No. 2 on the billboard top 200. The track \'Set to Fail\' also received a Grammy nomination amongst other Metal heavyweights such as Megadeth, Slayer, Judas Priest, and Ministry. They spent the remainder of 2009 touring in support of the new album and expect to continue touring through most of 2010.\n\nIn an interview with Spin Magazine, Chris Adler stated that the band currently has plans to begin work on their seventh album (title unknown) at the start of 2011. The album has been stated to be released either the end of 2011 or the beginning of 2012 and the band will not be doing any public performances until 2012 according to Morton\'s personal Twitter account.\n\nOn June 28, 2012, Randy Blythe was arrested in Czech Republic for alleged manslaughter. He was released on August 3 on a $400,000 bail until the criminal proceedings are finished. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lamb+of+God">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        content: 'Five Finger Death Punch were formed in 2005 by guitarist Zoltan Bathory (formerly of U.P.O.). The American Capitalist Songfacts states that Bathory came up with the name after being amused by a scene involving a five finger punch in Kill Bill 2.  Other members recruited to the band include former Motograter & Ghost Machine vocalist Ivan Moody, former W.A.S.P. members guitarist Darrell Roberts and drummer Jeremy Spencer, and former Anubis Rising/Deadsett bassist Matt Snell.\n\nThe band recorded their debut album The Way of the Fist in 2006 with Stevo "Shotgun" Bruno (Mötley Crüe, Prong) and Mike Sarkisyan (Spineshank). The record was mixed and mastered by former Machine Head/Soulfly guitarist Logan Mader.\nAfter making waves in the underground metal scene, in early June it was announced that the band had inked a deal with Firm Music, which is a branch of "The Firm", a highly successful management company (Korn, Staind, Limp Bizkit). Their debut album "The Way Of The Fist" was released on July 31, 2007 The record broke into the Billboard 200 on its first week of release, and hit the #1 position on Billboard\'s New Artist/Heetseekers chart. Their First single, "The Bleeding" landed in the top 40 rock radio charts, eventually worked its way into the top 10 and ruled the radio waves for an astonishing 8 months. In times when US Rock Radio is anything but friendly toward heavier bands, against all odds 5FDP not just repeated but surpassed their first single\'s success with their follow up "Never Enough". The song climbed even faster to set up a seemingly permanent camp in the top 10, until the 3rd single "Stranger Than Fiction" showed up on the horizon to take over the guard post.\nSupporting their release, for 19 consecutive months Five Finger Death Punch has relentlessly toured North America, eventually establishing themselves as a true headlining act and selling almost 300,000 records in the USA before branching out to the rest of the world. The international release of "The Way Of The Fist" (via Spinefarm/Universal) is scheduled to hit stores across the world in January 2009.\nRecently, it was announced that guitarist Darrel Roberts left the band and will be replaced by Jason Hook\nFive Finger Death Punch released "Under and Over It" as the first single from their third studio album, American Capitalist on July 27, 2011.
